In order to use Collletttivo typefaces on your website, you will need to:

#1 Upload the .woff2 files to your web server (or .woff2 in case of a variable version of the typeface)

#2 In your siteâ€™s CSS file, add an @font-face rule, similar to this:

@font-face {
  font-family: "FONT NAME";
  src: url("[directory_folder]/FILE_NAME.woff2") format("woff2");
}

#3 Now that you have defined a font-face rule, you can call it anywhere else in your CSS, like so:

h1 {
  font-family: "FONT NAME";
}



IMPORTANT NOTICE: we DO NOT offer a webfont hosting service, please do not reference the font files on our server when declaring font-face rules on your website. Files might change name and directory over time, breaking your font-face rules.
